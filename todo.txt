#### Must do

- Documentation for 
    a. usability and explanation of why this is something significant
    b. functionality and how it works (server and client)
- Script must totally wipe out what it has created
    I can use the "shred" command.
- Revoke/unrevoke certificates python methods[1]
- script wipes out everything
- prompt user if connection fails to re-login and re-download the bundle

# revoke
source ./vars
./revoke-full username // crl.pem is created automatically

# unrevoke
edit index.txt manually
source ./vars
openssl ca -gencrl -out "crl.pem" -config "$KEY_CONFIG"
