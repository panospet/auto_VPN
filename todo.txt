## to do list

Translate client_script to python, it's the best way to implement the cross-platform functionality.

#### Must do

1. Script must ask for authentication... DONE
2. Documentation for 
    a. usability and explanation of why this is something significant
    b. functionality and how it works (server and client)
3. client_script must be cross-platform (Linux, Windows, IOS)
    a. check out powershell
    b. take everything we need in a packet initially (are there portable versions of all those?)
4. Script must totally wipe out what it has created
    I can use the "shred" command.
5. Script must check if openvpn/curl/wget and other programs are installed. If not, it must install
   them or better use a portable version.
6. /register path for admin (must add code for adding/removing users).
7. Store passwords encrypted. (marked as optional)
