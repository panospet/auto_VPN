## to do list

Translate client_script to python, it's the best way to implement the cross-platform functionality.

#### Must do

- Script must ask for authentication... DONE
- Documentation for 
    a. usability and explanation of why this is something significant
    b. functionality and how it works (server and client)
- client_script must be cross-platform (Linux, Windows, IOS)
    a. check out powershell
    b. take everything we need in a packet initially (are there portable versions of all those?)
- Script must totally wipe out what it has created
    I can use the "shred" command.
- Script must check if openvpn/curl/wget and other programs are installed. If not, it must install them or better use a portable version.
- /register path for admin (must add code for adding/removing users).


#### Windows script todos
- client.ovpn file must be created dynamically
- test.py must have username/password/server_ip/certificate_filenames etc as variables
- test in another windows systems
- shred in windows?
